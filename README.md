b) server side rendering(dyanmic data comes from api and fetch)
c) incremental site regeneration(static+server)=> best

2) Performance

b) minifying files: remove extraspace and charcters 
c) image optimization: using next image component it make resposnive automatically
d) pre fetch assests

3) File Based Routing : When a file is added to the “pages” directory, it's automatically available as a route.
                        no need of installing extra package like in react
4) SEO
5) Serverless function :The function which takes the req and returns the response on the server but without hosting it on any server is basically a serverless function.
                           Inside the pages directory, craete api folder its contains serverless function.
